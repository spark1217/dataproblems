# Type 1 vs Type 2 error
### In statistical hypothesis testing, explain the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 error. You should be able to provide an example on the fly here.
  

##### Type 1 error

Reject h_0 when h_0 is actually true.  
e.g h_0: I don't have covid virus.  
    Test result shows that I have covid virus but I don't have covid virus in reality.  



##### Type 2 error
Accept h_0 when h_0 is actually false.  
e.g h_0: I don't have covid virus.  
    Test result says that I don't have covid virus but I actually have.  

##### null hypothesis(h_0)
The hypothesis that we want to varify during the research.

##### alternative hypothesis(h_1)
The opposite of the null hypothesis.
